## My process

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- React Dnd-Kit

### What I learned

This was my first time using TypeScript, Tailwind, and Dnd-kit, and I'm glad I took the opportunity to learn them all.

My first impression of TypeScript is that there's alot of setup and verbosity for even a small project, but I can already see the advantages it provides when working on a larger codebase (and with multiple devs).

I was unitially hesitant to use Tailwind. I had use Bootstrap many time and this just seemed like a more developed version of the same thing with all the same bloated class attributes. However once I installed the Prettier code formatting extension and began configuring my Tailwind setup I suprised at how easy the development experience was.

Dnd-Kit on the other hand presented many challenges.

### Continued development

Next version to include database and user authernticaion.

### Useful resources

- [React Dnd-Kit](https://dndkit.com/) - A fully featured and easy to yse React Drag-and-Drop toolkit.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Indispensible code formatter, especially for TS and Tailwind.
